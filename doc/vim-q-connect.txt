INTRODUCTION					*vim-q-connect*

This plugin provides editor context to Q CLI via Model Context Protocol
(MCP). It tracks your cursor position and current line, sending context
updates via Unix socket to Q CLI's MCP server.

COMMANDS					*vim-q-connect-commands*

:QConnect					*:QConnect*
		Start tracking editor context and connect to Q CLI's MCP server.

:QConnect!					*:QConnect!*
		Stop tracking editor context and disconnect from MCP server.

CONFIGURATION					*vim-q-connect-configuration*

g:vim_q_connect_socket_path			*g:vim_q_connect_socket_path*
		Custom socket path for MCP communication.
		Default: plugin directory + '/.vim-q-mcp.sock'
>
		let g:vim_q_connect_socket_path = '/path/to/custom.sock'
<

USAGE						*vim-q-connect-usage*

The plugin connects to Q CLI's MCP server on demand. Use :QConnect to start
tracking editor context.

To control the connection:
>
	:QConnect		" Start tracking
	:QConnect!		" Stop tracking
<

INTEGRATION					*vim-q-connect-integration*

Q CLI manages the MCP server lifecycle. The plugin only connects to an
existing server when you run :QConnect.

The MCP server provides `get_editor_context` and `goto_line` tools to
Q CLI for editor integration.
